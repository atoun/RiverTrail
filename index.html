      River Trail

    <p>JavaScript (known more formally as EcmaScript) has yet to embrace data parallelism for general computation. Meanwhile hardware is becoming more data parallel due to the improved calculation per watt advantage. This can be seen in both the vector instructions used within the CPU core and the other parallel hardware being integrated onto the CPU chip. For JavaScript to continue its success as the language of choice for web applications and to extend its success into critical areas such as image processing and gaming it must leverage this data parallel hardware. River Trail is our vision of a data parallel JavaScript that gently extends JavaScript with the ParallelArray prototype allowing the JavaScript programmer to leverage data parallelism from within the familiar JavaScript programming model instead of having to acquire an entirely new skill set simple to write data parallel programs. The vision maintains important attributes of JavaScript such as safety and security and fits comfortably within the browser and JavaScriptâ€™s runtime.
